# Decision Trees and Random Forerests Project

For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com.  


# Brief background:
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Investor want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the loan back. 

# Columns    
Column Name | Descriptions
------------ | -------------
credit.policy | 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
purpose | The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other")

# Problem:  
Which borrower have high probability of paying back the loan in full?

# Solution:
I will try to create a deascion tree model that will help predict wether or not the borrower will pay back the loan in full.
