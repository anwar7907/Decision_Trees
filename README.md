# Decision Trees and Random Forerests

For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com.    


# Brief background:
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Investor want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. 

# Problem:  
Which costumer have high probability of paying back the loan?

# Solution:
I will try to create a deascion tree model that will help predict which costumer will pay back and whicl will not.
